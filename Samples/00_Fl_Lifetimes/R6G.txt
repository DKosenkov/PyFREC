# Properties of the excited state of the molecular fragment Rhodamine-6G
#
# FORMAT OF EXCITED STATES (values in the list below):
# 1.   Excited state index  
# 2.   Absorption maximum, cm-1 (optional if tabulated absorption spectrum is provided)*
# 3-5. Transition dipole moment s x,y, and z components in a.u.*
# 6.   Emission maximum, cm-1 (optional if tabulated emission spectrum is provided)*
# 7.   Molar absorption (extinction) coefficient at the absorption maximum in M-1 cm-1*
# 8.  Quantum yield of the donor (unitless)*
# 9.  Lifetime of the donor excited state in the abscense of the acceptor in seconds*
